                    <h3>Context</h3>
                    <p>We wanted to create a web app that was meant to connect teacher from universities or colleges with their students and companies in the same platform. The main goal of this platform was to prepare students for the real world, working with real clients and projects.</p>
                    <h3>Solution</h3>
                    <p>We developed a PHP project running with my sql on the background, while developing the frontend with bootstrap. In the final solution, the teachers are able to create course outlines for companies to apply, manage applications, add students to a course, assign projects to students, create milestones, between many other features. </p>
                    <h3>My role and main contribution</h3>
                    <p>On this project, my role was to manage and lead the back end development. To start, I created a new and simple framework in order for our team to develop a solution on top of it. Also, I led the database design, development and deployment. Last but not least, I was in charge of deploying our solution, which was first done in heroku and was later on migrated to Digital Ocean.</p>

                        <h3>Context</h3>
                        <p>I participated in the Global Jam 2018, a gaming hackathon that took place on the last weekend of January. Basically, the event was meant for participants to build a game from scratch over the weekend (46 hours). The only rule was that it had to be related to the topic that was disclosed at the beggining, which this year happened to be <b>Transmission</b>.</p>
                        <h3>Solution</h3>
                        <p>After evaluating the technologies and skills of the members of the team that we assembled on site, we decided to develop a Node.js backend with a JavaScript front-end. Basically, the game would consist on gaining money over time depending on the amount of planets that have been conquered. The money would be used to buy satellites to reach further posisions and also to put flags on a planet to conquer them (once in range).</p>
                        <h3>My role and main contribution</h3>
                        <p>I was in charge of leading the bussiness logic of the front-end that was done in JavaScript. Also, I developed a random map generator that would initialize the initial state of the game, depending on the variables that were given.</p>

                        <h3>Solution</h3>
                        <p>We created a restaurant site which was themed on marxism. All the different pages have JavaScript on them, giving a more dynamic and modern feel to the site. </p>
                        <h3>My role and main contribution</h3>
                        <p>I was a crucial part on the organization of the team, developing many common areas like the home page, footer and header, between others. Also, I was in charge of creating the site map, which lets you see a preview of the site you are looking at, and the contest, which in our case was a tic tac toe (which can onlye be beaten in easy).</p>
